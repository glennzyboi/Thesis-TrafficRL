```markdown
| **JohnPaul** | **5-way** | **14** | **5** | 9,800 |
```

**Why critical:** Shows your system handles complex, non-standard intersections

---

### 2. Complete Hyperparameter Table
**Location:** Part 1, Section 4.2.6

**What to add:** Full table with exact values:
- Learning Rate: 0.0005
- Discount Factor: 0.95
- Epsilon Decay: 0.9995
- Batch Size: 64
- Replay Buffer: 75,000
- Target Update: 0.005
- LSTM Sequence: 10
- Episodes: 350

**Why critical:** Enables reproducibility, shows rigor

---

### 3. Anti-Cheating Code Snippets
**Location:** Part 2, Section 4.3.3.1

**What to add:** All 5 measures with code:
1. Disabled teleportation
2. Min/max phase times (12s/120s)
3. Forced cycle completion (200s)
4. TSP priority (6s override)
5. No future information

**Impact:** 8% performance reduction (expected and acceptable)

**Why critical:** Demonstrates academic honesty, shows you prevented exploitation

---

### 4. Passenger Capacity Justifications
