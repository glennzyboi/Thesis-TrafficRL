# Final Training Protocol - Defense-Ready D3QN MARL Agent

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** READY FOR EXECUTION  
**Research-Based:** Traffic Signal Control RL Literature (2020-2024)  

---

## Training Configuration

### Research Basis

From traffic signal control literature:
1. **Offline Pretraining:** 100-200 episodes saturates learning from fixed scenarios
2. **Online Fine-tuning:** 2-3× longer (300-600 episodes) for policy stabilization
3. **Optimal Split:** 60-70% offline, 30-40% online for best generalization
4. **Total Episodes:** 300-400 episodes for robust convergence

**Our Dataset:** 46 training scenarios (66 total)

### Selected Protocol: **350 Episodes (70-30 Split)**

**Phase 1: Offline Pretraining (245 episodes - 70%)**
- Fixed rotation through 46 training scenarios
- 5.3 passes through entire training set
- Goal: Learn stable baseline policy from diverse traffic patterns
- Expected: Loss stabilization, epsilon → 0.01

**Phase 2: Online Fine-tuning (105 episodes - 30%)**  
- Random sampling from training scenarios
- Goal: Generalization, adaptation, robustness
- Expected: Performance refinement, final convergence

---

## Hyperparameters (Research-Validated)

```python
# Learning & Exploration
learning_rate = 0.0003  # Conservative for stability
epsilon_decay = 0.9995  # Reaches ~0.01 by episode 200
min_epsilon = 0.01  # Maintain minimal exploration

# Experience Replay
memory_size = 50,000  # 170+ full episodes worth
batch_size = 64  # Balance speed vs stability

# Q-Learning
gamma = 0.95  # Long-term reward focus (reasonable for 5-min episodes)
target_update_freq = 10  # Polyak averaging every 10 episodes

# Neural Network
lstm_sequence_length = 10  # Temporal pattern learning
hidden_layers = [256, 256]  # Sufficient capacity
activation = 'relu'  # Standard for RL

# Regularization
gradient_clipping = 1.0  # Prevent exploding gradients
huber_loss_delta = 0.5  # Robust to outliers
dropout = 0.0  # Not needed with proper replay buffer
```

---

## Reward Function (Optimized for Throughput)

**Formula:**
```python
reward = (
    # Throughput Focus (65%)
    + 0.65 * normalized_throughput
    + 0.12 * throughput_bonus  # >90% of ideal
    
    # Congestion Management (28%)
    - 0.28 * normalized_waiting_time
    - 0.03 * spillback_penalty  # Gridlock prevention
    
    # Flow Quality (7%)
    + 0.07 * normalized_speed
)
```

**Rationale:**
- **65% throughput focus** to meet thesis goal (≤-10% degradation, aim for improvement)
- **28% waiting time** to maintain user experience
- **7% speed** as flow quality indicator
- **Bonuses/penalties** for exceptional performance/critical failures

---

## Anti-Cheating Policies

1. **No Vehicle Teleportation:** `--time-to-teleport -1`
2. **Long Waiting Time Memory:** `--waiting-time-memory 10000`
3. **Phase Timing Constraints:**
   - Min green: 10s (realistic signal change cost)
   - Max green: 60s (prevent phase hogging)
   - Min cycle: 60s (traffic engineering standard)
   - Max cycle: 180s (prevent gridlock from long cycles)
4. **Forced Cycle Completion:** All phases must get green time
5. **Public Transport Priority:** Bonus for bus/jeepney throughput
6. **State Observation Realism:** Only observable SUMO metrics (no future info)

---

## Validation & Early Stopping

**Validation Protocol:**
- Every 20 episodes during offline (12× total)
- Every 10 episodes during online (10× total)
- 3 validation episodes per check (from 13 validation scenarios)

**Early Stopping Criteria:**
- Patience: 40 episodes (no improvement in validation performance)
- Min delta: 1% relative improvement
- Metric: Average validation reward

**Reason:** Prevent overfitting while allowing sufficient exploration

---

## Expected Training Duration

**Per Episode:**
- Warmup: 30s
- Simulation: 300s (5 min traffic)
- Processing: ~30s (replay, logging, model update)
- **Total: ~6 minutes/episode**

**Total Training Time:**
- 350 episodes × 6 min = **2,100 minutes = 35 hours**
- **With validation:** ~40 hours
- **Estimated:** **1.7 days of continuous running**

---

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goal (Thesis Requirement)
✅ **Throughput degradation ≤ -10%** vs Fixed-Time baseline
🎯 **Target: ≥ 0%** (parity or improvement)

### Secondary Goals
- ✅ Waiting time reduction: ≥ 10%
- ✅ Speed improvement: ≥ 5%
- ✅ Queue reduction: ≥ 5%
- ✅ Statistical significance: p < 0.05, Cohen's d > 0.5

### Training Goals
- ✅ Loss convergence: < 0.1 by end of training
- ✅ Policy stability: < 5% reward variance in final 50 episodes
- ✅ No catastrophic forgetting: Validation performance maintains within 10% of peak

---

## Monitoring & Logging

**Per Episode:**
- Reward (cumulative)
- Loss (average)
- Epsilon (exploration rate)
- Completed trips
- Avg waiting time
- Avg speed
- Avg queue length

**Per Validation:**
- All above metrics across 3 validation episodes
- Comparison to best validation performance
- Early stopping check

**Production Logger:**
- JSONL format: `production_logs/{experiment}_episodes.jsonl`
- System status every 30s
- GPU/CPU utilization (if available)

**Visualizations (Auto-generated at end):**
- Training curves (reward, loss, epsilon)
- Performance metrics over time
- Validation vs training performance
- Final evaluation comparison plots
