## Executive Summary

The D3QN traffic signal control system has been successfully enhanced with comprehensive route generation, improved training stability, and extended training capabilities. The system now supports 400+ episode training with optimized performance metrics and academic-grade methodology.

## Current System Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Route Generation Pipeline

#### **Primary Route Generation Scripts:**
- `scripts/generate_scenario_routes.py` - Main scenario-based route generation
- `scripts/generate_balanced_routes.py` - Balanced traffic distribution routes  
- `scripts/consolidate_bundle_routes.py` - Route consolidation and bundling

#### **Route Generation Features:**
- **Data-driven Generation**: Routes generated from real traffic data (July-August 2025)
- **Specific Clean Routes**: Custom routes for Ecoland, JohnPaul, and Sandawa intersections
- **Exit Edge Validation**: Vehicles only exit on valid edges (106768822, 1102489120, 934492019#6, -935563495#2, -1046997839#6, 106609720#4)

- **Enhanced Traffic Distribution**: Realistic traffic patterns across all intersections
- **Route Validation**: All routes validated for network connectivity
- **Consolidated Bundles**: 195 routes per consolidated bundle (75 Ecoland + 90 JohnPaul + 30 Sandawa)

### 2. Extended Training Configuration

#### **Training Parameters (Updated January 2025):**
```python
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    "episodes": 400,                    # Extended from 250 for better convergence
    "learning_rate": 0.0003,           # Optimized for stability
    "epsilon_decay": 0.9998,           # Slower exploration decay
    "memory_size": 75000,              # Increased experience diversity
    "batch_size": 128,                 # Larger batches for stability
    "early_stopping_patience": 30,     # Extended patience for longer training
    "validation_freq": 15,             # More frequent validation
    "save_freq": 25,                   # More frequent checkpoints
}
```

#### **Training Performance Analysis:**
Based on 250-episode training results:
- **Convergence Point**: ~150-200 episodes
- **Reward Stability**: Consistent performance around 330-340 reward points
- **No Overfitting**: Stable performance without degradation
- **Room for Improvement**: Throughput optimization potential identified
