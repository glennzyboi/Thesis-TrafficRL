# PERFORMANCE FIXES IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. REWARD FUNCTION OVERHAUL
**Problem**: High rewards (300-600) but poor actual performance (-106% waiting time, -51% throughput)

**Solution**: Performance-aligned reward function with direct correlation to traffic metrics
- **Waiting Time Reward (40%)**: Target < 6s (fixed-time: 5.79s)
- **Throughput Reward (30%)**: Target > 5,000 veh/h (fixed-time: 5,328 veh/h)  
- **Speed Reward (15%)**: Target > 20 km/h (fixed-time: 20.60 km/h)
- **Queue Management (10%)**: Target < 80 vehicles (fixed-time: 70.21)
- **Passenger Throughput (5%)**: Thesis focus on PT vehicles

**Expected Impact**: Direct correlation between rewards and actual traffic performance

### 2. STATE REPRESENTATION SIMPLIFICATION
**Problem**: 208-dimensional state too complex, causing learning instability

**Solution**: Simplified to ~50 dimensions focusing on essential metrics
- **Lane Metrics (3 per lane)**: Queue length, waiting time, speed efficiency
- **Intersection Metrics (3 per intersection)**: Total waiting, total queue, phase efficiency
- **Global Metrics (5 total)**: System load, throughput rate, time of day, system speed, density

**Expected Impact**: Better learning convergence and stability

### 3. ACTION SPACE ENHANCEMENT
**Problem**: Basic action space without coordination or PT priority

**Solution**: Intelligent action space with coordination and PT priority
- **Intelligent Phase Selection**: PT vehicles get priority
- **Coordination Effects**: Intersections coordinate to avoid conflicts
- **Phase Timing Constraints**: Respect minimum phase times
- **PT Benefit Calculation**: Weight PT vehicles by waiting time

**Expected Impact**: Better traffic flow coordination and PT priority

### 4. TRAINING CONFIGURATION
**Problem**: Suboptimal learning parameters

**Solution**: Optimized parameters for better convergence
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0005 (balanced)
- **Epsilon Decay**: 0.9995 (balanced exploration)
- **Memory Size**: 75,000 (diverse experience)
- **Batch Size**: 128 (stable learning)
- **Gamma**: 0.95 (long-term focus)

## EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

### **Target Metrics (vs Fixed-Time Baseline)**
- **Waiting Time**: < 5.79s (currently 11.95s) - **CRITICAL**
- **Throughput**: > 5,328 veh/h (currently 2,611 veh/h) - **CRITICAL**
- **Speed**: > 20.60 km/h (currently 17.09 km/h) - **IMPROVE**
- **Queue Length**: < 70.21 vehicles (currently 106.31) - **IMPROVE**
- **Completed Trips**: > 222 (currently 193) - **IMPROVE**

### **Reward Function Alignment**
- **Before**: High rewards (300-600) but poor performance
- **After**: Rewards directly correlate with traffic efficiency
- **Target**: Rewards should reflect actual performance improvements

## TESTING PROTOCOL

### **Phase 1: 20-Episode Test** (Current)
- Verify fixes work without errors
- Check reward correlation with performance
- Validate state representation stability
- Confirm action space functionality

### **Phase 2: Extended Training** (Next)
- 100-200 episodes with performance monitoring
- Compare against fixed-time baseline
- Analyze learning progression
- Validate thesis objectives

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Files Modified**
1. `core/traffic_env.py`:
   - `_calculate_reward()`: Complete rewrite with performance alignment
   - `_get_state()`: Simplified state representation
   - `_apply_action()`: Enhanced with intelligent coordination

2. `config/training_config.py`:
   - Updated episode count for testing
   - Optimized learning parameters

3. `experiments/comprehensive_training.py`:
   - Updated default episode count

### **Key Features**
- **Performance-Aligned Rewards**: Direct correlation with traffic metrics
- **Simplified State**: Focus on essential traffic information
- **Intelligent Actions**: PT priority and intersection coordination
- **Optimized Learning**: Better convergence parameters

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **Immediate (20 episodes)**

- Stable reward progression
- Improved performance vs previous runs

### **Extended (100+ episodes)**
- Beat fixed-time baseline across all metrics
- Achieve thesis objectives (passenger throughput focus)
- Demonstrate learning convergence
- Validate research contribution

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Monitor 20-episode test** for stability and improvements
2. **Analyze results** and identify any remaining issues
3. **Run extended training** (100-200 episodes) if test successful
4. **Compare performance** against fixed-time baseline
5. **Document findings** for thesis defense
