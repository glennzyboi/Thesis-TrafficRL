# Accelerated 4-Day Training Plan for Thesis Completion

**Timeline:** October 8-11, 2025 (4 days)  
**Objective:** Complete all training, evaluation, and analysis for thesis defense  
**Critical Success Factors:** Focus on Non-LSTM, aggressive reward rebalancing, parallel processing  

## Overview

Given the 4-5 day constraint, we need to **compress** the original 4-6 week plan into an intensive sprint. This means:
- Running shorter but more focused training sessions
- Leveraging best current results
- Parallel testing where possible
- Immediate decision-making on what works

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

---

## **Day 1: Aggressive Reward Rebalancing & Quick Validation** (Oct 8)

### Morning (8 AM - 12 PM): Implementation

**Tasks:**
1. **Update passenger capacities** with Davao City-specific values
2. **Implement aggressive reward rebalancing**
3. **Test reward function** with 5-episode sanity check

**Reward Configuration:**
```python
reward = (
    waiting_reward * 0.15 +      # 15% (cut from 28%)
    throughput_reward * 0.55 +   # 55% (up from 45%)
    speed_reward * 0.10 +        # 10% (down from 15%)
    queue_reward * 0.05 +        # 5% (down from 10%)
    pressure_term * 0.05 +       # 5% (maintained)
    throughput_bonus * 0.20      # 20% (up from 12%)
    # Removed passenger_bonus - consolidate into throughput
)
```

**Commands:**
```bash
# Quick 5-episode sanity check
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type non_lstm \
  --episodes 5 \
  --experiment_name sanity_check_aggressive_reward
```

**Decision Point:** If episodes complete without errors and rewards look reasonable ‚Üí proceed

### Afternoon (1 PM - 6 PM): Quick Validation Test

**Tasks:**
1. **Run 30-episode validation** for Non-LSTM (primary focus)
2. **Run 20-episode validation** for LSTM (comparison only)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Non-LSTM 30-episode test
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type non_lstm \
  --episodes 30 \
  --experiment_name non_lstm_aggressive_30ep_test

# LSTM 20-episode test (parallel if possible)
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type lstm \
  --episodes 20 \
  --experiment_name lstm_aggressive_20ep_test
```

**Expected Duration:** 3-4 hours per run

### Evening (6 PM - 9 PM): Analysis & Decision

**Tasks:**
1. **Analyze 30-episode results**
2. **Check throughput improvement**
3. **Decide on final reward weights**

**Decision Criteria:**
- Throughput improved to -23% or better ‚Üí **Proceed with current weights**
- Throughput at -24% to -26% ‚Üí **Minor adjustment, proceed**
- Throughput worse than -26% ‚Üí **Moderate weights slightly**

**Output:** Finalized reward configuration for main training

---

## **Day 2: Offline Pretraining (Compressed)** (Oct 9)

### Full Day (8 AM - 10 PM): 100-Episode Offline Training

**Strategy:** Instead of 150 episodes, run **100 episodes** (balances time vs convergence)

**Tasks:**
1. **Start Non-LSTM 100-episode training** (primary)
2. **Start LSTM 60-episode training** (comparison, if time permits)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Non-LSTM offline training (PRIORITY)
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type non_lstm \
  --episodes 100 \
  --experiment_name non_lstm_offline_100ep_final

# LSTM offline training (if system can handle parallel)
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type lstm \
  --episodes 60 \
  --experiment_name lstm_offline_60ep_final
```

**Expected Duration:** 10-12 hours for 100 episodes

**Monitoring:**
- Check progress every 25 episodes
- Look for convergence patterns
- Monitor loss stability
- Track throughput trends

**Evening Task:**
- If training finishes early, start preliminary analysis
- Identify best checkpoint model
- Document training progress

---

## **Day 3: Online Fine-tuning & Evaluation** (Oct 10)

### Morning (8 AM - 12 PM): Quick Online Phase

**Strategy:** Instead of 300 episodes, run **100-episode online fine-tuning**

**Rationale:**
- Offline training (100 ep) already provides good foundation
- Online phase focuses on adaptation, not learning from scratch
- 100 episodes sufficient for fine-tuning (research shows 50-100 is adequate)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Load best offline model and continue training
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type non_lstm \
  --episodes 100 \
  --experiment_name non_lstm_online_100ep_final \
  --load_model comprehensive_results/non_lstm_offline_100ep_final/models/best_model.keras
```

**Expected Duration:** 10-12 hours

### Afternoon/Evening (1 PM - 10 PM): Let Training Run

**Tasks:**
- Monitor training progress
- **Parallel task:** Start writing methodology section
- Prepare evaluation scripts
- Organize previous results for comparison

---

## **Day 4: Final Evaluation & Analysis** (Oct 11)

### Morning (8 AM - 12 PM): Comprehensive Evaluation

**Tasks:**
1. **Run Fixed-Time comparison** (25 episodes for statistical power)
2. **Generate all performance metrics**
3. **Create visualizations**

**Commands:**
```bash
# Comprehensive comparison with Fixed-Time baseline
python evaluation/performance_comparison.py \
  --experiment_name non_lstm_online_100ep_final \
  --num_episodes 25
```

**Expected Duration:** 2-3 hours

### Afternoon (1 PM - 4 PM): Statistical Analysis

**Tasks:**
1. **Run paired t-tests** (D3QN vs Fixed-Time)
2. **Calculate effect sizes** (Cohen's d)
3. **Generate confidence intervals**
4. **Compare with LSTM results**

**Output:**
- Performance comparison tables
- Statistical validation report
- Publication-ready plots

### Late Afternoon (4 PM - 7 PM): Results Documentation

**Tasks:**
1. **Write Results section**
2. **Create comparison tables**
3. **Finalize all plots**
4. **Document key findings**

### Evening (7 PM - 10 PM): Discussion & Conclusions

**Tasks:**
1. **Write Discussion section**
2. **Compare with literature**
3. **Document limitations**
4. **Write conclusions**
5. **Prepare defense slides**

## Contingency Plans

**Plan C:** Combine with existing 100-episode results if performance is similar

### **If Throughput Still Poor After Day 1**

**Plan A:** Further increase throughput weight to 60-65%
**Plan B:** Reduce waiting time weight to 10%
**Plan C:** Focus defense on multi-objective optimization success

### **If Time Runs Out on Day 4**

**Plan A:** Use existing evaluation results from 100-episode training
