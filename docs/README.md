## Quick Reference

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Aggressive reward rebalancing complete** (70% throughput focus)
- ‚úÖ **Davao City passenger capacities implemented**
- ‚úÖ **100-episode training complete** for both LSTM and Non-LSTM
- ‚è≥ **Next:** Run validation test with new reward weights

### Key Findings
- **Non-LSTM outperforms LSTM** by 7.7% in throughput
- **Training stability** 40% better with Non-LSTM
- **Waiting time over-performing** at +33-37% improvement
- **Throughput under-performing** at -27% to -32% degradation

### Immediate Action
```bash
# Day 1: Validation testing
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py --agent_type non_lstm --episodes 5 --experiment_name sanity_aggressive_reward
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py --agent_type non_lstm --episodes 30 --experiment_name non_lstm_aggressive_30ep
```

## File Cleanup (October 7, 2025)

**Removed 21 outdated documentation files** to maintain clarity and focus on current thesis objectives:
- Old progress reports
- Superseded analysis documents
- Redundant comparison files
- Outdated technical guides
- Historical vulnerability fixes

**Result:** Clean, focused documentation aligned with thesis goals.
