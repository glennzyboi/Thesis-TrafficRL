**Generated:** October 7, 2025  
**Context:** 100-episode training comparison with rebalanced reward function  
**Purpose:** Document key findings for thesis methodology section  

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive 100-episode training comparison reveals that **Non-LSTM architecture significantly outperforms LSTM** in traffic signal control tasks with limited training data. This analysis provides critical insights for methodology documentation and architectural decision-making.

## Root Cause Analysis: Why Non-LSTM Outperforms LSTM

### 1. **Data Scarcity and LSTM Overfitting**

**Problem:** LSTM layers require substantial temporal sequences to learn meaningful patterns, but our traffic data is limited.

**Evidence:**
- **Training Episodes:** Only 100 episodes (30,000 total steps)
- **Sequence Length:** 10 timesteps per LSTM input
- **Data Diversity:** Limited scenario variety across different traffic conditions
- **Parameter Count:** LSTM has 146,597 parameters vs Non-LSTM's 262,887 parameters

**Mechanism:**
```
LSTM Learning Process:
- Requires long sequences to learn temporal dependencies
- Limited data → Insufficient pattern recognition
- High parameter count → Overfitting to training scenarios
- Poor generalization to unseen traffic conditions

Non-LSTM Learning Process:
- Processes each state independently
- Larger dense layers provide better feature extraction
- More parameters distributed across spatial features
- Better generalization with limited data
```

### 2. **Architectural Complexity vs Data Availability**

**LSTM Architecture Issues:**
- **Temporal Memory:** LSTM maintains hidden states across timesteps
- **Sequence Dependency:** Requires consistent state sequences
- **Gradient Flow:** Vanishing gradients in long sequences
- **Memory Requirements:** Higher computational overhead

**Non-LSTM Architecture Advantages:**
- **Direct State Processing:** Each state processed independently
- **Feature Focus:** Dense layers focus on spatial traffic features
- **Stable Gradients:** No temporal gradient issues
- **Computational Efficiency:** Faster training and inference

### 3. **Traffic Signal Control Specificity**

**Traffic Signal Characteristics:**
- **Immediate Response:** Traffic signals need immediate response to current conditions
- **State Independence:** Current traffic state is more important than historical patterns
- **Action Impact:** Phase changes have immediate, observable effects
- **Real-time Requirements:** Decisions must be made quickly

**Why Non-LSTM Works Better:**
- **Current State Focus:** Emphasizes immediate traffic conditions
- **Spatial Features:** Better at processing lane-specific information
- **Action-Response:** Direct mapping from state to action
- **Stability:** Consistent performance across different scenarios
