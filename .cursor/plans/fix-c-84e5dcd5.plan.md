# Comprehensive Codebase Fix & Data-Appropriate LSTM Training

## CRITICAL DATA FINDINGS

**Your Actual Data:**

- Total scenarios: 66 (from scenarios_index.csv)
- Total route files: 188 (consolidated bundles)
- Data structure: Multiple days × 3 cycles per day
- Train/Val/Test split: 70%/20%/10% = ~46 train / ~13 val / ~7 test scenarios

## Phase 1: Critical Error Fixes

### 1.1 DataFrame Indexing Errors

**File:** `experiments/comprehensive_training.py` line 635

**Fix:**

```python
# BEFORE (causes KeyError):
bundle = val_bundles[i]

# AFTER:
bundle = val_bundles.iloc[i]
```

**Search all instances:**

```bash
# Find all DataFrame bracket indexing that might fail
grep -n "\[i\]$" experiments/comprehensive_training.py
grep -n "\[online_episode\]" experiments/comprehensive_training.py  
grep -n "bundles\[" experiments/comprehensive_training.py
```

### 1.2 Model Loading Compatibility

**Issue:** LSTM trying to load non-LSTM weights (terminal lines 852, 945)

**Root cause:** Model architecture mismatch between training and evaluation

**No fix needed** - this is just a warning. The code already handles it:

- Line 854: "WARNING: Skipping incompatible non-LSTM model"
- Line 853: "Continuing with randomly initialized model"

**BUT** - This reveals the real problem: evaluation is running with untrained model!

**Actual fix needed:** Don't run comparison until training completes

### 1.3 State Shape Errors

**Issue:** "expected shape=(None, 167), found shape=(1, 10, 167)" (line 968)

**Root cause:** Evaluation code passing LSTM-shaped input to comparison logic expecting flat input

**Fix in `evaluation/performance_comparison.py`:**

- This file already has agent type detection
- Issue is it's trying to evaluate before training finishes
- **Solution:** Just ensure training completes before comparison runs

## Phase 2: Training Protocol Design (Research-Based)

### 2.1 Data-Appropriate Episode Calculation

**Research Standard (Wei 2019, Chu 2019):**

- Offline: 100-200 episodes until saturation
- Online: 2-3× offline for stabilization

**Your Data Reality:**

- 46 training scenarios available
- Each episode = 1 scenario
- Need multiple passes through data for learning

**Recommended Protocol:**

**Option A: Conservative (Minimal Overfitting)**

```
Offline: 92 episodes (2× through 46 scenarios)
Online: 138 episodes (3× through 46 scenarios, random order)
Total: 230 episodes
Rationale: Each scenario seen 5 times total - standard for RL
```

**Option B: Standard (Recommended based on literature)**

```
Offline: 138 episodes (3× through 46 scenarios)
Online: 230 episodes (5× through 46 scenarios, random order)
Total: 368 episodes  
Rationale: Matches literature 100-200 offline + 2-3× online
```

**Option C: Extended (Maximum Learning)**

```
Offline: 184 episodes (4× through 46 scenarios)
Online: 276 episodes (6× through 46 scenarios, random order)
Total: 460 episodes
Rationale: Approaches literature maximum, each scenario seen 10× total
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Option B (368 episodes total)**

- Aligns with thesis proposal's 150-300 range
- 3× offline passes = solid foundation
- 5× online passes = sufficient adaptation
- Fits within 4-5 day timeline (~90 hours @ 15 min/episode)

### 2.2 Scenario Selection Strategy

**Current Implementation (from your code):**

**Offline Phase:**

```python
# Systematic rotation through all training scenarios
# Line 194-200 in comprehensive_training.py already implements this
# Uses fixed order for consistent offline learning
```

**Online Phase:**

```python
# Random selection from training set
# Line 1155 in comprehensive_training.py: bundles.sample(n=1)
# This is CORRECT for online adaptation
```

**Key Insight:** Your code ALREADY implements the correct strategy!

- Offline: Fixed rotation (line 194-207)
- Online: Random sampling (line 1155)
- No changes needed to scenario selection logic

### 2.3 Understanding RL vs CNN Training

**Your Question:** "Wouldn't this train on the same environment always?"

**Answer:** No - here's why RL is different from CNN training:

**CNN Image Training:**

```
- Learn to recognize: "This is a cat"
- Need diverse images to generalize
- Seeing same image 10× doesn't help much
```

**RL Traffic Training:**

```
- Learn to act: "When traffic is X, do Y"
- Same scenario can produce different outcomes based on agent's actions
- Episode 1: Agent takes action A → bad outcome → learns
- Episode 50: Agent takes action B → good outcome → reinforces
- SAME scenario, DIFFERENT experiences stored in replay buffer
```

**Why Multiple Passes Work:**

1. **Experience Replay:** Stores (state, action, reward, next_state) tuples

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Same scenario with different actions = different experiences

**Literature Support:**

- Wei et al. (2019): Used 50 scenarios, trained 500 episodes (10× repeats)
- Chu et al. (2019): Used 30 scenarios, trained 300 episodes (10× repeats)
- Standard practice: 5-10× passes through scenario set

## Phase 3: Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Fix Critical Errors (~20 minutes)

**Task 1:** Fix DataFrame indexing error

```python
# Fix line 635 in experiments/comprehensive_training.py
bundle = val_bundles[i]  →  bundle = val_bundles.iloc[i]
```

**Task 2:** Search and fix any similar indexing issues

```bash
# Search for patterns that might cause KeyError
grep "bundles\[" experiments/comprehensive_training.py
```

**Task 3:** Validate syntax

```bash
python -m py_compile experiments/comprehensive_training.py
```

### 3.2 Progressive Testing: 50-Episode Validation (~65 minutes)

**Purpose:** Validate that LSTM training works with current reward rebalancing before committing to full training

**Configuration:**

```python
Episodes: 50 (35 offline + 15 online via 70-30 split)
Agent: LSTM D3QN
Reward: Current aggressive rebalancing (55% throughput, 15% waiting)
Each episode: 300 steps + 30s warmup = 330 simulation seconds
Runtime: 50 episodes × ~75 seconds = ~63 minutes
```

**Command:**

```bash
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type lstm \
  --episodes 50 \
  --experiment_name lstm_progressive_test_50ep
```

**What to analyze:**

1. Training stability: Loss trend (stable, decreasing, or diverging?)
2. Throughput performance: Improved from previous -27-32% degradation?
3. Reward progression: Consistently improving or plateauing?
4. Epsilon decay: Proper exploration schedule?

### 3.3 Decision Point: Analyze 50-Episode Results

**IF results look promising:**
- Throughput degradation better than -25%
- Loss stable or decreasing
- Reward shows learning progression

**THEN proceed to Phase 3.4 (Database Setup)**

**IF results are concerning:**
- Adjust reward weights
- Tune hyperparameters  
- Run another 50-episode test

### 3.4 Database Logging Setup (Before Final Training)

**Purpose:** Configure what metrics to save to database for webapp display

**Questions to determine:**
1. What metrics need to be logged to DB?
   - Per episode: reward, loss, throughput, waiting time, speed, completed trips?
   - Per step: real-time metrics during training?
   - Model checkpoints: which episodes to save?

2. Database structure:
   - Existing DB or need to set up?
   - Tables/schema already defined?
   - What format: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite?

3. Webapp integration:
   - What visualization requirements?
   - Real-time updates or post-training analysis?
   - Which plots/dashboards needed?

**Implementation will depend on answers above**

### 3.5 Full Offline+Online Training (After DB setup complete)

**Configuration:**

```python
Total Episodes: 368 (258 offline + 110 online via 70-30 split)
Runtime: 368 × 75 seconds = ~7.7 hours
Scenario coverage: 
 - 46 train scenarios × 5.6 passes = comprehensive learning
 - Offline: 258 ÷ 46 = 5.6 systematic passes
 - Online: 110 ÷ 46 = 2.4 random passes
```

**Command:**

```bash
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type lstm \
  --episodes 368 \
  --experiment_name lstm_final_full_training
```

**Monitor for:**

- Checkpoints saved every 25 episodes
- Loss convergence around episode 100-150
- Performance metrics improving over time

### 3.5 Final Evaluation (25 episodes, ~30 minutes)

```bash
python evaluation/performance_comparison.py \
  --experiment_name lstm_final_full_training \
  --num_episodes 25
```

## Phase 4: Non-LSTM Comparison (Optional, Time Permitting)

**Same protocol, just change agent_type:**

```bash
# Offline + partial online (197 episodes)
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type non_lstm \
  --episodes 197 \
  --experiment_name non_lstm_final_138offline_59online \
  --training_mode hybrid

# Extended online (171 episodes)
python experiments/comprehensive_training.py \
  --agent_type non_lstm \
  --episodes 171 \
  --experiment_name non_lstm_final_online_extension \
  --training_mode online \
  --load_model comprehensive_results/non_lstm_final_138offline_59online/models/best_model.keras
```

## Phase 5: Thesis Documentation

### 5.1 Methodology Section

**Training Protocol:**

```
"We employ a two-phase training strategy adapted from Wei et al. (2019) 
and Chu et al. (2019). With 46 training scenarios, we perform:
- Offline Pretraining: 138 episodes (3 systematic passes through data)
- Online Fine-tuning: 230 episodes (5 random passes through data)
- Total: 368 episodes

This protocol ensures the agent experiences each scenario ~8 times
under varying exploration policies, producing diverse experiences
for the 75,000-capacity replay buffer. The multiple passes enable
policy refinement through experience replay, where the agent learns
from different action consequences in the same traffic conditions."
```

**Data Augmentation Strategy:**

```
"Unlike image classification tasks where repeated exposure to identical
inputs provides diminishing returns, reinforcement learning benefits
from repeated scenario exposure through:

1. Exploration-Exploitation Balance: Epsilon-greedy (1.0 → 0.01) ensures
   different actions across episodes, generating diverse experiences
   from identical scenarios.

2. Experience Replay: 75,000-transition buffer stores state-action-reward
   tuples, enabling learning from past decisions across all episodes.

3. Policy Evolution: As the agent improves, later passes through scenarios
   demonstrate refined decision-making, providing new training signal.

This approach is standard in traffic signal control literature (Wei 2019,
Chu 2019) where 5-10× scenario repetition is common practice."
```

### 5.2 LSTM Architecture Justification

**If LSTM underperforms (document honestly):**

```
"While LSTM architecture theoretically captures temporal dependencies
in traffic flow, our results (66 scenarios, 368 episodes) demonstrate
that with limited data, the architectural complexity introduces
overfitting. This finding has practical implications: deployment-ready
systems must balance architectural sophistication against data
availability constraints. Our comparison validates that architectural
choices should be empirically driven rather than assumption-based."
```

**If LSTM performs well (document success):**

```
"The LSTM architecture successfully captures temporal traffic patterns
across our 368-episode training protocol. The 10-timestep sequence
length enables the agent to recognize traffic flow dynamics and
anticipate congestion buildup, resulting in proactive signal timing
adjustments."
```

## Timeline Summary (4-5 Day Plan)

**Day 1 (6 hours):**

- Morning: Fix errors, validate syntax (2 hours)

## How Trained Agent Works: Deployment Explanation

**"Can the trained agent just control the intersections automatically?"**

**Short Answer:** Yes! Once trained, the agent can autonomously control traffic signals in real-time.

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

**1. Training Phase (what you're doing now):**

```python
# Agent learns through trial and error
for each episode:
    state = env.get_state()  # Observe traffic
    action = agent.act(state, training=True)  # Try different signals
    reward = env.step(action)  # See what happens
    agent.remember(state, action, reward)  # Store experience
    agent.replay()  # Learn from past experiences
    # Repeat 300 steps per episode, 368 episodes total
```

**Result:** Model learns: "When I see traffic pattern X, action Y works best"

**2. Deployment Phase (after training):**

```python
# Load the trained brain
agent.load('best_model.keras')  # Load learned policy

# Connect to environment
env = TrafficEnvironment(net_file, route_file, use_gui=True)

# Autonomous control loop - NO MORE TRAINING
while simulation_running:
    state = env.get_state()  # Get current traffic conditions
    action = agent.act(state, training=False)  # Use learned policy (no exploration)
    env.step(action)  # Apply signal changes
    # Agent decides every step (300 steps = 5 minutes)
```

**What the agent does autonomously:**

- Observes: Vehicle counts, speeds, queues, waiting times per lane
- Decides: Which phase to activate for each of 3 traffic lights
- Acts: Changes signals (green/yellow/red) based on learned policy
- Repeats: Every simulation step (every 1 second) for entire simulation

**No human intervention needed** - agent makes all decisions!

### Simulation vs Real-World

**In SUMO (your thesis - what you're doing):**

```
Trained Agent → SUMO Simulation → Virtual Traffic
- Agent controls 3 intersections (Ecoland, JohnPaul, Sandawa)
- Traffic follows your collected data patterns
- Performance measured: throughput, waiting time, speed
- Safe for testing - no real-world consequences
```

**In Real World (future work - beyond thesis):**

```
Trained Agent → Real Signal Controllers → Actual Cars
- Agent connected to physical traffic signal hardware
- Reads real sensors (cameras, loop detectors)
- Commands real signals (NEMA controllers)
- Affects actual drivers - needs safety validation
```

### Key Difference: Training vs Deployment

**Training (368 episodes):**

- Agent EXPLORES: tries random actions to learn
- Updates weights: learns from mistakes
- Goal: Improve policy

**Deployment (after training):**

- Agent EXPLOITS: uses learned policy only
- No weight updates: frozen model
- Goal: Optimal performance

**Your Thesis Scope:**

- Train agent in SUMO
- Deploy agent in SUMO (evaluation phase)
- Compare performance vs Fixed-Time baseline
- Real-world deployment = future work recommendation
