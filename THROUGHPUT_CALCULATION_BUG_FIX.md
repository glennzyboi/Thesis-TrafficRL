# üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIX: Throughput Calculation Error

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **BUG FIXED - RE-RUNNING EVALUATION**  
**Impact:** This bug caused D3QN to appear -31.6% worse when it was actually +15% better!  

---

## The Bug

**File:** `evaluation/performance_comparison.py`, line 369

**WRONG CODE:**
```python
'avg_throughput': np.mean([d['throughput'] for d in step_data if d['throughput'] > 0]),
```

**What it did:**
- Took per-step instantaneous throughput values
- Averaged them across all 300 steps
- **Completely incorrect** for measuring overall throughput!

**Why it's wrong:**
- Per-step throughput fluctuates wildly (0 to thousands)
- Averaging these gives a meaningless number
- Fixed-Time used the CORRECT formula: `completed_trips / simulation_duration_hours`
- D3QN used the WRONG formula: `average(per_step_values)`

---

## The Paradox This Caused

**From Evaluation Results:**
```
Completed Trips:
  Fixed-Time: 425.80 trips
  D3QN:       489.20 trips  ‚Üê D3QN completed MORE trips!
  
Throughput (BUGGY):
  Fixed-Time: 5,677 veh/h
  D3QN:       3,886 veh/h  ‚Üê But LOWER throughput???
```

**This is mathematically impossible!**  
If D3QN completed MORE trips in the SAME time, throughput MUST be higher!

**The bug:** D3QN throughput was calculated incorrectly.

---

## The Fix

**CORRECT CODE:**
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Calculate throughput correctly from completed trips / time
simulation_duration_hours = (300 - 30) / 3600  # (num_seconds - warmup_time) / 3600
completed_trips = step_data[-1]['completed_trips']  # Cumulative at end

metrics = {
    ...
    'completed_trips': completed_trips,
    'avg_throughput': completed_trips / simulation_duration_hours,  # FIXED!
    ...
}
```

**What it does now:**
- Uses the exact same formula as Fixed-Time baseline
- `avg_throughput = completed_trips / 0.075 hours`
- Matches the definition of throughput: vehicles per hour

---

## Corrected Results (Expected)

**With the fix:**
```
Fixed-Time Throughput: 425.80 / 0.075 = 5,677 veh/h ‚úÖ
D3QN Throughput:       489.20 / 0.075 = 6,523 veh/h ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

Performance: (6,523 - 5,677) / 5,677 = +14.9% improvement!
```

**This matches the completed trips improvement of +14.9%!**

---

## Impact on Results

### Before Fix (WRONG):
- D3QN Throughput: 3,886 veh/h
- Fixed-Time Throughput: 5,677 veh/h
- Performance: **-31.6% degradation** ‚ùå

### After Fix (CORRECT - Expected):
- D3QN Throughput: 6,523 veh/h
- Fixed-Time Throughput: 5,677 veh/h
- Performance: **+14.9% improvement** ‚úÖ

### Change:
- **From -31.6% to +14.9%**
- **46.5 percentage point swing!**
- **From failure to major success!**

## All Metrics (Expected Corrected Results)

| Metric | Fixed-Time | D3QN | Change | Status |
|--------|------------|------|--------|--------|
| **Throughput** | 5,677 veh/h | **6,523 veh/h** | **+14.9%** | ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** |
| **Waiting Time** | 10.84s | 7.11s | **-34.4%** | ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** |
| **Speed** | 14.46 km/h | 15.56 km/h | **+7.6%** | ‚úÖ **GOOD** |
| **Queue Length** | 94.08 | 89.52 | **-4.8%** | ‚úÖ **GOOD** |
| **Completed Trips** | 425.80 | 489.20 | **+14.9%** | ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** |
| **Max Queue** | 163.32 | 132.04 | **-19.2%** | ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** |

**ALL METRICS IMPROVED!** ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

## Comparison to Training

**Training (188 episodes):**
- Average throughput: 5,834 veh/h
- vs Baseline: +5.9%

**Evaluation (25 episodes, CORRECTED):**
- D3QN throughput: 6,523 veh/h
- vs Baseline: +14.9%

**Difference:** Evaluation shows BETTER performance than training!

**Possible reasons:**
1. Test scenarios might be slightly easier
2. Best model (Episode 45) performs better than average
3. 25 episodes is smaller sample, higher variance
4. Training average includes early learning episodes

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why this bug existed:**

1. **Inconsistent metric calculation:**
   - Fixed-Time used: `completed_trips / time`
   - D3QN used: `average(per_step_throughput)`
   - Two different formulas for the same metric!

2. **Misleading variable names:**
   - `info['throughput']` from environment is instantaneous
   - Should be called `instantaneous_throughput` or `current_rate`
   - Using it for `avg_throughput` was wrong

3. **No cross-validation:**
   - Didn't verify D3QN calculation against completed trips
   - Should have caught: 489 trips ‚Üí 3,886 veh/h doesn't make sense!

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Validate Metrics

**Red Flag:**
```
Completed Trips: +14.9%
Throughput: -31.6%
```

These MUST move in the same direction! If they don't, there's a bug.

### 2. Use Consistent Formulas

All agents/baselines must use the SAME formula for the SAME metric.

**Correct approach:**
```python
# Define once, use everywhere
def calculate_throughput(completed_trips, simulation_duration_hours):
    return completed_trips / simulation_duration_hours
```

### 3. Sanity Check Results

**Before celebrating OR despairing:**
1. Check if numbers make sense
2. Verify against other metrics
3. Compare to training results
4. Review code for consistency
