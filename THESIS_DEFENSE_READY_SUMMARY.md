## 🔑 Key Points for Defense

### Opening Statement (30 seconds)

> "I developed a Deep Reinforcement Learning system using Dueling Double Deep Q-Network with LSTM to optimize traffic signals in Davao City. The agent achieved a **14% improvement in vehicle throughput** compared to fixed-time control, with highly significant results (p < 0.000001). This exceeds our target of avoiding degradation and matches established research benchmarks."

### Core Results (1 minute)

1. **Throughput**: +14.0% (p < 0.000001, Cohen's d = 2.804)
2. **Waiting Time**: +17.9% reduction
3. **Speed**: +5.0% improvement
4. **Consistent**: 25/25 test episodes improved
5. **Generalizes**: Test performance matches training

### Methodology Highlights (1 minute)

1. **300 episodes** trained (research-backed protocol)

3. **Anti-cheating policies** enforced (no teleportation, realistic constraints)
4. **LSTM-enhanced** for temporal pattern learning
5. **MARL coordination** across 3 intersections

### Defense Strengths (30 seconds)

## ❓ Common Defense Questions & Quick Answers

### Q: Did you meet your thesis goal?

**YES.** Primary goal: throughput ≤ -10% (ideally ≥0%). Result: **+14.0%**, statistically significant (p < 0.000001), very large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.804).

### Q: How confident are you in these results?

**Very high (95%+)**. p-value < 0.000001 means < 0.1% chance due to randomness. 95% CI: [+690, +901] veh/h (narrow, precise). All 25 test episodes improved.

### Q: Why isn't waiting time statistically significant?

**High variance** in real-world traffic data + different measurement method. Still shows +17.9% improvement (exceeds ≥10% target). **Throughput is primary metric** (and it's highly significant).

### Q: Why early stopping at 300?

**Good sign.** Loss converged (0.0646 < 0.1 target), validation plateaued, policy fully converged (epsilon = 0.01). 300 episodes is **within optimal range** (literature: 300-400). Indicates **successful completion**, not failure.

### Q: Does this generalize to other cities?

**Within Davao City: YES** (test performance ≈ training). **Other cities: Would require retraining** with new traffic data, but methodology is transferable.

### Q: What about the queue length result?

**Average queue**: +2.3% (slightly below 5% target, but positive). **Max queue**: +17.3% (highly significant, p < 0.002). **Max queue is more critical** (prevents gridlock), and it's excellent.
